A country may also take debt to manage its economy. For example, infrastructure spending is one costly ingredient required for a country's citizens to lead comfortable lives. In this project, we are going to analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank.

## General Information
In this notebook, we are going to analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. We are going to find the answers to questions like:

*What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?

*Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?

*What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.10.5
- PostgreSQL

## Setup
You need to download the "international_debt.csv" file. The first line of code connects us to the "international_debt" database where the table "international_debt" is residing. That's why you need to create this database/table in your database environment.

## Usage
In this project we try to analyze some data from World Bank. Anyone try to use some debt data in his/her project can use this project. Plus, I think that you can use this data as a template based on your debt visualization project if you try to visualize some inferences of debt data from World Bank.
